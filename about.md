I'm Ruth, an Applied Scientist at Microsoft. 

I'm fascinated by the nuances of various trade-offs that arise in ML, and I enjoy thinking about ways to effectively balance competing objectives. Understanding these sorts of trade-offs is what first drew me to ML in undergrad and continues to interest me at my current role. You may notice this as a recurring theme in my blog posts.
