I'm Ruth, an Applied Scientist at Microsoft.

I'm fascinated by the nuances of different trade-offs that arise in ML, and thinking about effective ways to find balance between competing objectives. Understanding these sorts of trade-offs is what first drew me to ML in undergrad and continues to interest me at my current role. You may notice this as a recurring theme in my blog posts.
